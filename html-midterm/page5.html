    <h1>Page 1</h1>
    <p>The issue was that the table was never closed in the code before using "h2". In order to fix the issue I added the closing table </p>
    <p>line 22 was missing the closing tag so I needed to add an li closing tag</p>
    <p>Line 34 missing a closing tag for td so I added a td closing tag at the end</p>
    <p>Missing a tr closing tag on line 40 so I added a tr closing tag</p>
    <p>Was missing a character set at the top of the page so I added charset at the top between head tag</p>
    <p>Changed where the image.png was being pulled from because it wasn't pulling from the right location</p>

    <h1>Page 2</h1>
    <p>The problem was the h2 was missing the backslash so it wasn't correctly closed. I added the backslad to close h2 so it would be a proper heading</p>
    <p>The problem was there were spaces in the href link so in order to fix it I just added underscores connecting the words instead of spaces</p>
    <p>There was an hr tag instead of an h6 on line 73 so I changed it to h6 so it would close and become a proper heading</p>
    <p>On line 51 the h2 tag was inside the b tag so I moved the h2 tag outside the the bold tag</p>
    
    <h1>Page 3</h1>
    <p>This whole page was missing the whole doctype html so I added the doctype</p>
    <p> the title, meta and css link was missing so I needed to add all of that informaiton using title, meta, and a href link </p>
    <p>missing the lang tag so I added the lang tag to the top of the page </p>

    <h1>Page 4</h1>
    <p> It was missing the doctype and html so I added that to line 1</p>
    <p>All of the lines that had images were missing the alt tag so I needed to add an alt tag with a description of the image </p>
    <p>lines 41 and 46 were missing the beginning of the td tag so I added the td to the beginning of the line on both lines</p>
