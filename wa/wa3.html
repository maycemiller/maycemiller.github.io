    <h1>Pickleball</h1> 
    <br>  Pickleball is a racket or paddle sport in which two (singles) or four (doubles) players hit a perforated, hollow plastic ball with paddles over a 34-inch-high (0.86 m) net until one side is unable to return the ball or commits an infraction. Pickleball is played indoors and outdoors. It was invented in 1965 as a children's backyard game in the United States, on Bainbridge Island in Washington state. In 2022, pickleball was named the official state sport of Washington.[2]

    <div id = "Etymology">
<p><strong>Etymology</strong> </p>
<p>The game was created in 1965 on <a href="inbridge_Island,_Washingtonhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bainbridge_Island,_Washington">Bainbridge Island</a>, Washington, at the summer home of Joel Pritchard, who later served in the United States Congress and as Washington's lieutenant governor.[3] Pritchard and two of his friends, Barney McCallum and Bill Bell, are credited with devising the game and establishing the rules.

    According to Joan Pritchard, Joel Pritchard's wife, "The name of the game became Pickle Ball after I said it reminded me of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_pickleball_terms#P">pickle boat</a> in crew where oarsmen were chosen from the leftovers of other boats."[4] Other sources state that the name "pickleball" was derived from the name of the Pritchards' family dog, Pickles.[5] The Pritchards stated that the dog came along after the game had already been named, and it was the dog that was named for the game of pickleball.[6] They said the confusion arose when a reporter interviewing the Pritchards in the early 1970s decided it would be easier for readers to relate to the dog rather than a pickle boat. Representatives of USA Pickleball claim that research on their part has confirmed that the dog Pickles was born after the game had already been named.[7]
    
    Jennifer Lucore and Beverly Youngren, authors of the book History of Pickleball: More than 50 Years of Fun!, say that they could not conclusively determine whether the game was named for the dog or the dog was named for the game.[8] They did, however, discover a third possibility: Bill Bell claimed that he had named the game because he enjoyed hitting the ball in a way that would put his opponent in a pickle.[9]
    
    Shortly after the game was invented, some of its inventors and their friends brought pickleball to Hawaii, where the game became known as pukaball. Puka, meaning "hole" in Hawaiian, was at first used to refer to the ball, since pickleballs have numerous holes, and later used to refer to the game itself.[10]</p>

    <div id = "Court">
    <p><strong>Court and Equipment</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Court</strong>
    <br>
    The regulation size of the court is 20 feet (6.1 m) by 44 feet (13 m) for both doubles and singles, the same size as a doubles badminton court. A line seven feet from the net is the non-volley line. Twenty-two feet from the net, the baseline marks the outer boundary of the playing area. The area bounded by the non-volley line, the sidelines, and the net, including the lines, is known as the non-volley zone or "kitchen". The area between the non-volley line and the baseline is the service court. A center line divides the service court into left and right sides.[37] Regulated tournaments and games are usually played on a specialized polyurethane sport surface; however, courts are often set up on concrete, Astroturf, and indoor basketball courts.[38]
    
    <br><strong>Net</strong> 
    The net is 36 inches (0.91 m) high on the ends and 34 inches (0.86 m) high at the center. The net posts should be 22 feet (6.7 m) from the inside of one post to the inside of the other post.[39]
    
    <br><strong>Ball</strong>
    A Wiffle ball was the original ball used when the game was invented. USA Pickleball (USAP) and the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) have since adopted specific ball standards unique to pickleball. Balls must be made of a durable molded material with a smooth surface and must have between 26 and 40 evenly spaced circular holes. They must weigh between .78 and .935 ounces (22.1 and 26.5 g) and measure between 2.87 and 2.97 inches (73 and 75 mm) in diameter. Tournaments sanctioned by the USAP and IFP must choose from a list of preapproved balls found on the USAP and IFP websites.[40]
    
    Balls with smaller holes are generally used for outdoor play to minimize the effects of wind, but any sanctioned ball can be used for either indoor or outdoor play.[26]
    
    <br><strong>Paddle</strong>
    For sanctioned games, USAP and IFP paddle size standards say the combined length and width of the paddle shall not exceed 24 inches (0.61 m); the length cannot exceed 17 inches (0.43 m).[41] There are no requirements regarding thickness or weight. The paddle must be made of a non-compressible material and the surface of the paddle must be smooth. Paddles used in sanctioned tournaments must be on the list of preapproved paddles found on the USAP and IFP websites.[42]</p>

    <p><strong>Order_of_Play</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Announcing the score and serving</strong>
       <br> The score is announced before each serve by an official or the server.
        
        In doubles: the score has three parts; the serving team’s score, the receiving team’s score, and the server number, a "1" or "2" that indicates whether the server is the serving team′s first or second server. The first server of the game is always considered the serving team's second server and may call the server number "start" or "2". The starting score in doubles is announced as "zero zero two (0 0 2)".[43][44][45]
        
        In singles: The score has two parts; the serving player's score and the receiving player′s score. The starting score in singles is always announced as "zero zero".
        
        The first serve of the game comes from the right service court or the "even service" court.</p>
